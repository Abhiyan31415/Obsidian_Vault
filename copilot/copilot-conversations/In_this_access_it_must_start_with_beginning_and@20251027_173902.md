**user**:   In this access it must start with beginning and read through a speicifc linear sequence. this means access time of data unit depends on positon of records and previous location. what  does this mean

**ai**: This describes **sequential access** in a memory system. It means that to get to a specific piece of data, you have to go through all the data that comes before it in the sequence. The time it takes to access the data depends on where it is in the sequence and where you were previously located.

**ai**: A classic example of sequential access is a magnetic tape. To access data in the middle of the tape, you have to rewind or fast-forward through all the preceding data. The further the desired data is from the current position, the longer it takes to access.
